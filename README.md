## Inspiration
Many of our team members love learning languages but often struggle to stay motivated. We wanted to create a fun, engaging platform to help users study languages in an interactive way. Plus, we’re all cat lovers, so naturally, we had to incorporate a playful cat persona to make the experience even more enjoyable!

## What It Does
- **Interactive Learning:** Practice real conversations with an AI chatbot that adapts to your language level, complete with witty, pesky humor that makes every chat entertaining and delightful.  
- **Multilingual Support:** Learn in any of 7 supported languages, ranging from Spanish to Chinese.  
- **Note-Taking:** Take notes during each language lesson, and log in anytime to review and build upon your past notes.  
- **Rewarding Progress:** Earn points for language learning efforts and use them to buy adorable items to decorate your cat avatar and profile, making learning both productive and fun!


## What We Learned
- Gained deeper knowledge of **Next.js**, implementing complex features like a chat screen and a database/inventory system.
- Developed skills in designing and managing a **complex inventory and database system**.
- Explored **AWS DynamoDB** and **AWS Bedrock** for the first time, which gave us a solid foundation in cloud services.
- Learned the importance of teamwork, especially when navigating different time zones and busy schedules.

## How We Built Our Project
- **Frontend:** Built using **Next.js** for the application logic and **Tailwind CSS** and **Lottie** for dynamic fun cat animations and responsive designs.

- **Backend:** Powered by various **AWS services**: 
  - **DynamoDB**: noSQL database to store user notes, store inventory, purchases, and equipped profile items.
  - **Bedrock**: To integrate the AI cat persona for interactive chats. 
  - **S3**: For storing media assets like user avatars and profile items.
  - **Polly**: To provide text-to-speech capabilities for pronunciation assistance. 
  - **qDeveloper**: For debugging and monitoring the application. 

## Challenges
- Navigating AWS services as first-time users required significant learning and troubleshooting.
- Designing a flexible yet efficient database to handle user notes, inventory management, and customizations was challenging but rewarding.
- Managing teamwork with teammates in different time zones and balancing our schedules made collaboration more complex but taught us valuable time management skills.

## What's Next for PolyPal
- **User Profiles in the Navbar:** Load saved profiles directly to the navigation bar
- **Room Customizer & Shop:** Users can buy furniture, decorations, and other items to customize their cat’s virtual room. 

We’re proud of how we overcame these hurdles to deliver a fun, interactive language learning app that blends AI technology with a touch of feline charm!
